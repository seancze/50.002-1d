## Contents

### ALU

The implementation of our Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) and a testing interface (using Alchitry Io shield)

### LEDMatrix

Standalone code of LEDMatrix built upon [Prof Nat's Repo](https://github.com/natalieagus/SampleAlchitryProjects/tree/master/MatrixLEDTest)

**Key features**

1. UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT arrow mappings
2. Dynamically generate and centralise shapes on LED
3. Use up arrow to increase the number of arrows appearing on LED matrix
4. Use right arrow to change the type of arrow displayed on the LED matrix

### Runes

Our complete game! Key the runes (arrows) in order to unlock the secrets to acing\* Computation Structures! :)

_\*Effort and exam smarts sold separately_

PS: **Click [here](https://youtu.be/M7g4iqoyrY0)** to watch our Youtube trailer :)

**Key features**

1. Press start to play the game
2. Key the runes in order within 2s to +1 to your score
3. Reset the game at any point of the game
4. Inputting the correct input turns the arrow from WHITE to GREEN
5. Randomly and dynamically generates new arrows for each level
6. (Frustration-friendly feature) Typing a wrong input only resets you to the start of the current level, not the entire game (you're welcome)
7. 0-9 digit mappings
